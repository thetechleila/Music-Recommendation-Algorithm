    "#### **Here are my insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ####  The 2010s are the decade with the highest amount of songs released in the dataset with 5631 total compared to the starting decade of the 1950s in which 1,467 songs were released. \n",
    "\n",
    "* ####      **The *specific* year with the highest amount of songs released is 2017 with 660 total songs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ####  There aren't any songs in the dataset with an age of true 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ####  The total count of the absolute oldest songs in the dataset is: 51. This means that songs from 1950 account for just 0.00179% of all songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### The majority of music in the dataset is relatively recent (closer to age 0, with release dates closer to 2019 than 1950 - the year at the start of the dataset.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### There are 3308 artists with more than one song and 2116 artists with just 1 song in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### The top 5 most popular artists in the dataset are: \n",
    "    * ####  Johnny Cash with 190 songs\n",
    "    * ####  Ella Fitzgerald with 188 songs\n",
    "    * ####  Dean Martin with 146 songs\n",
    "    * ####  Willie Nelson with 131 songs\n",
    "    * ####  George Jones with 107 songs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Sadness, Violence and World/Life account for 60.70% of all song topics in the dataset.\n",
    "    * #### Sadness = 6094 songs\n",
    "    * #### Violence = 5707 songs\n",
    "    * #### World/Life = 5419 songs\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### The 3 least common song topics are Night/Time, Romantic, and Feelings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Feelings are the topic of 612 songs, only 2.2% of all songs. \n",
    "\n",
    "* #### The average word count per song is 73 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ####  Pop is the dominant genre overall and most pop songs in the dataset are from the 1990s and the 2010s.\n",
    "    * #### The 1950s have the lowest amount of pop songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  #### Hip Hop is the least prevalent genre in any decade, which makes sense as the genre was created in the 1980s.\n",
    "    * #### Thusly, Hip Hop is only present starting from the 1980s to 2010s\n",
    "    * #### The 2010s contain the majority of the Hip Hop songs in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ####  The 2010s are the dominant decade for most genres **except** Country where most of the songs are from the 1980s and 1990s.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ####  The amount of Reggae songs in the dataset increases every decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ####  The 2010s is the most dominant decade for the \"Obscene\" and the \"Violence\" topics by far.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* ####  The amount of songs with Obscene subject matter steadily increases every decaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ####  1980 is the dominant decade for songs about sadness\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No columns were *highly* correlated (meaning no columns have >0.5 correlation between each other) except for the age column which has a predictable negative/inverse correlation with itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### There is a *moderate* correlation of .44 between *len* (a song's word count) and *obscene* (A score from 0 to 1 expressing how likely it is that this songâ€™s lyrics have something to do with obscene content (money, rockstar-lifestyle, etc)). This may indicate that songs with obscene content trend closer towards the mean song length of 73 words than others."
